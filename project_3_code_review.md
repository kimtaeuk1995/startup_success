[X] README.md included
[X] Slides included
[X] Code included

## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Might be a tad difficult to follow due to the lack of comments and explanations. For instance, provide an analysis of the graphs and coefficents. 
  Basically, treat the notebook like you're slowly walking/talking someone through your project. Make no assumptions that they know whats going on.
- Use python functions & include docstrings.In future projects move toward these can be moved to separate .py modules and imported.



## Good Documentation:

- Good & informative README.md
- Use more markdown cell at beginning of .ipynb to explain analysis, scope, and reasonings for current
- Inline code comments were used sparingly, include more to help explain what is taking place
- Could use more markdown cells throughout as section headings and explaining decisions made

## Proper Data Science:

- Good choice on your scoring metric F-beta
- Tuning your F-beta or trying to ensemble to see if you can improve your scores 


## Comments:

- Good job on project 3
- I believe you have a solid foundation of the data science concepts. Enhancement for future projects are simply in organizing your code
